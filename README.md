## Workflow
Here we describe how to compile, link and run the assembly program in the simulator. Here it is assumed that the assembly source code is located at the **src/**, as it should.
1. Using the command line, go to the **tools/** folder
2. Compile your source code, using **asm source**
3. Link and create the executable, using **lnk source**
4. Run the simulator, using **sim source**
5. Use the **go** or **trace** directives to run the instructions
